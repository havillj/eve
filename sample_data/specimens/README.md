## Sample specimen data

These files contain unmapped reads, with their paired-end mates, extracted from the complete genomic data of 4 example specimens from La Lope, Gabon.  

The software will recognize from the `unmapped_with_mates.bam` suffix that this initial step has already been completed on the specimen.

These are provided in place of the original files to save space and time.
